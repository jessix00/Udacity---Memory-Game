# Udacity-Memory-Game
Project two of Udacity's Nano Degree Program

## About
This project is part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Course and it requires the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Concept
This Memory Game asks users to find matching cards. If the user finds a match, both cards will flip open. This will continue 
until the user finds all cards. While the user is playing, stats like time, moves and stars are being stored.
Once all cards are found, the game ends and a modal opens that will display the user's stats. 
The modal will also ask the user if he/she would like to play again. If a user plays again, all stats are reverted to zero and the deck 
is shuffled again, ready for a new game.
